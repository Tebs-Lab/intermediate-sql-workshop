# Exercise: Common Table Expressions

1. Join any three tables and select every row. Now, using the CTE syntax select a subset of the rows from the join. (this is to practice the syntax in a simple way)

2. Create a query that uses an aggregate to determine each sales person's largest and smallest sale on a monthly basis. Then, use that query as a table with the CTE syntax, and select from it using another aggregate  to compute the average of each sales person's smallest and largest sales. (this "double aggregate" is a major benefit of CTEs)

3. Combine a CTU with Union! Make a query that involves any numerical field, then using three selects and three unions `sum` that numerical value using...
    1. All values.
    2. Odd values.
    3. Even values.

Union these three selects into a single query with 3 rows.
